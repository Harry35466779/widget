  0: "<b>No Progress:</b> At 0% annual AI improvement, AI technology makes no meaningful advances. The economic and investment landscape remains static, with traditional industries continuing to dominate. <span class='investment-highlight'>AI is irrelevant at this level.</span> Investors stick to legacy strategies as innovation stagnates. Human expertise goes unchallenged, and any talk of digital transformation stays a mere buzzword.",
  10: "<b>Incremental Gains:</b> At up to 10% annual AI improvement, progress is modest and incremental. AI may deliver minor efficiency gains or automate basic tasks, but core business models remain largely unchanged. <span class='investment-highlight'>Safe, stable companies remain the default choice for investors.</span> Early adopters of AI gain only a slight edge, and the overall market still rewards conservative, low-risk strategies.",
  20: "<b>Early Momentum:</b> At over 20% annual AI improvement, AI becomes a significant productivity driver. Companies embracing AI begin to outpace those that do not, drawing increased investor attention toward these digital leaders. <span class='investment-highlight'>Gradually shifting portfolios toward innovation proves beneficial.</span> Experimentation with AI is rewarded, and the first notable wave of white-collar automation and workforce reskilling emerges.",
  30: "<b>Compounding Effects:</b> At over 30% annual AI improvement, the impact of AI on performance becomes unmistakable in company earnings and productivity. Firms investing heavily in AI gain accelerating advantages, while traditional businesses start to fall behind. <span class='investment-highlight'>The risk of disruption rises sharply.</span> Active, agile management is rewarded as product cycles shorten and digital expertise becomes a baseline requirement across industries.",
  40: "<b>Disruption Phase:</b> At over 40% annual AI improvement, AI-driven disruption is widespread across the economy. Entire industries undergo rapid transformation as automation accelerates and data-driven upstarts outcompete legacy firms. <span class='investment-highlight'>Market volatility increases significantly.</span> Adaptability becomes paramount: investors look beyond traditional sectors and evaluate ecosystems, strategic partnerships, and continuous upskilling when allocating capital.",
  50: "<b>Transformation:</b> At over 50% annual AI improvement, the pace of business and societal change becomes rapid and relentless. Virtually every sector faces dramatic upheavals, and new opportunities emerge faster than investors can easily track. <span class='investment-highlight'>Identifying and supporting agile, innovative companies becomes essential.</span> Corporate lifespans shorten, and capital flows toward organizations that prioritize continuous learning and adaptation.",
  80: "<b>Acceleration:</b> At over 80% annual AI improvement, AI becomes a dominant force in the economy. The most advanced companies scale at unprecedented rates, and entirely new markets and business models appear almost overnight. The breakneck pace of change strains the ability of regulators and investors to keep up. <span class='investment-highlight'>Broad diversification and strategic flexibility are essential.</span> Global labor markets are radically reshaped, and many regulatory frameworks struggle to remain relevant under these conditions.",
  100: "<b>Exponential Shift:</b> At over 100% annual AI improvement, technological progress turns exponential, fueling massive growth and a concentration of power among leading AI-driven firms. Only companies with the most advanced AI capabilities continue to thrive, while traditional sector boundaries blur or disappear entirely. <span class='investment-highlight'>Financial markets become almost unrecognizable compared to today.</span> Economic models start shifting from scarcity-based to abundance-based paradigms. Political tensions escalate over data governance, access to AI resources, and control of these powerful technologies.",
  200: "<b>AI Dominance:</b> At over 200% annual AI improvement, compounding advances hit a tipping point that upends the economy and society almost overnight. Conventional investment logic breaks down as AI-driven decisions and automation reshape markets in real time. <span class='investment-highlight'>Traditional analysis becomes nearly meaningless\u2014AI's trajectory is everything.</span> Corporate winners and losers are decided by algorithmic prowess and data access rather than any legacy advantages. The gap between AI leaders and laggards widens into a chasm.",
  300: "<b>Runaway Growth:</b> At over 300% annual AI improvement, technological change reaches runaway speed. Entire industries can be reinvented within months instead of years, leaving little time for traditional strategic planning. <span class='investment-highlight'>The only constant is change.</span> Investors now depend on adaptive, AI-driven strategies, as human decision-making alone struggles to keep up. New systemic risks, ethical dilemmas, and unforeseen social consequences emerge on a global scale.",
  400: "<b>Superintelligent Era:</b> At over 400% annual AI improvement, the global landscape is dominated by superintelligent systems. Nearly all human labor becomes obsolete, and economic value creation hinges on access to advanced AI infrastructure. <span class='investment-highlight'>Risks and opportunities multiply exponentially.</span> Societal rules and institutions are rewritten to accommodate this new reality, and managing existential AI risks becomes a standard part of prudent investment strategy.",
  500: "<b>Post-Scarcity:</b> At over 500% annual AI improvement, the very foundations of investment, economics, and society are overturned. Concepts of scarcity fade as AI-driven automation delivers overwhelming abundance. <span class='investment-highlight'>New post-scarcity models, autonomous AI-run organizations, and novel forms of value creation emerge.</span> Traditional notions of wealth, labor, and ownership are fundamentally redefined. In this world of abundance and constant reinvention, only those willing to radically adapt can survive and thrive."
